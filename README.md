# Isofragmented_Reactions

This provides access to a jupyter notebook that will allow the user to run the full process of using isofragmented reactions to estimate a molecules enthlapy of formation. 
More information on this project can be found in the paper "Automated Identification of Isofragmented Reactions and Application in Data-Driven Molecular Property Models."

A Google Collabratorry version of this notebook is availible here: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PZYcqtB4RwZ75T57XFqfOQOWwKvLY6hG?authuser=1) 


The file Isofragmented_Reactions provides the capability for the model to be run locally.
