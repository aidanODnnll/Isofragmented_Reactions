# Isofragmented_Reactions

This provides access to a jupyter notebook that will allow the user to run the full process of using isofragmented reactions to estimate a molecules enthlapy of formation. 
More information on this project can be found in the paper "Automated Identification of Isofragmented Reactions and Application in Data-Driven Molecular Property Models."
