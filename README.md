# Isofragmented_Reactions

This provides access to a jupyter notebook that will allow the user to run the full process of using isofragmented reactions to estimate a molecules enthlapy of formation. It also provides an example of how the code functions.  
More information on this project can be found in the paper "Automated Identification of Isofragmented Reactions and Application in Data-Driven Molecular Property Models."

A Google Collabratorry version of this notebook is availible here: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PZYcqtB4RwZ75T57XFqfOQOWwKvLY6hG?authuser=1) 


The file Isofragmented_Reactions provides the capability for the model to be run locally. In this file the jupyter notebook is the same as the Google collab version just altered to run locally. The python file xxxxx only provides the user the capability to run the model on their own set of molecules.
